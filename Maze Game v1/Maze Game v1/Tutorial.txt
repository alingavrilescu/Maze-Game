TUTORIAL:

The goal in the maze game is to complete the maze alive.

The interactions in the game:

You can move in the maze using the arrow keys.

The Shamans (S): 
These guys are fantastic creatures which can increase your strenght for a price.
They can be found in dead corners of the maze. 
The same Shaman can not increase your power twice. They will disappear after they power you up.

The Bandits (E):
Cunning enemies which will attack you the second you give them the chance.
You better increase your powers fast because these guys are a threat and if they can beat you you will lose your money or even your life.
You will need at least 10 strenght to be able to beat these enemies.

The Bandits' Boss (B):
He, is the final boss of the maze, a ruthless killer. If you are not strong enough to beat him you will lose your life on the spot.
You will need at least 25 strenght to be able to beat this foe.

Small chests (=):
These small chests do not give you a lot but they are for free so there is no point in leaving them unlooted.

The Big Chest ($):
This is the biggest chest you can find in the maze. You have to travel a lot to reach it but it is worth the trouble.

The Keys (C):
Universal keys that can open any door but they get destroyed in the process.

The Doors (+):
Locked doors that block the path. They can only be opened by keys you find in the maze.

The lamp (L):
It is a normal lamp which will enlighten your way through dark places in the maze.

The Player (P):
The character you are playing with.

The maze does not have any light in it. You have only the map to help you get through the maze. 
On the harder difficulty a part of the map you have is erased so you will have to find a lamp to find your way throught the erased part of the map.
That is all. Have fun in your adventure.
